   <h2>INFORMATION ABOUT PAGE</h2>
   <p><b>THE AVERAGES</b> are a team of fictional superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, 
    based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963. Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury,
     the team is a United States-based organization composed primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, 
     described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's protection from a variety of threats. 
     The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and 
     subsequently in the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York. Arranged as an ensemble of core MCU characters originally consisting of 
     Tony Stark / Iron Man, Steve Rogers / Captain America, Thor, Bruce Banner / Hulk, Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, and Clint Barton /
     Hawkeye, and later expanding to include 16 members. They are central to the MCU's first 23 films, collectively known as the Infinity Saga, and are consequently 
     regarded as an important part of the franchise.
    The Avengers from alternate universes were depicted in various properties from Phase Four of the MCU, including appearances 
    in the first season of the Disney+ animated series What If (2021–present) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). The Avengers are set to return in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). 
    Both films will be part of the MCU's Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga.</p>
